<h1 style="color:blue;"><strong>What is Software Testing?</strong></h1>


**Definition:**
Software testing is the process of **evaluating a software application or system to determine whether it meets specified requirements and works as intended**. It involves the systematic execution of test cases to identify defects, ensure quality, and validate that the software performs correctly in expected scenarios.

**Key Points:**

* **Purpose:** Detect defects, ensure correctness, reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.
* **Scope:** Can include functional testing, non-functional testing, verification, and validation.
* **Approach:** Involves manual testing, automated testing, or a combination of both.
* **Outcome:** Provides confidence in the software’s quality and suitability for release.

**In short:**

> Software testing ensures that the software is **both correct and fit for its intended use**.

<h2 style="color:#ff7f0e;"><strong>Verification and Validation in Software Testing</strong></h2>

### Verification

checking each stage of construction

**Definition:**
Verification is the process of evaluating work-products of a development phase to ensure that they meet the specified requirements and design specifications. It answers the question:

> “Are we building the product correctly?”

**Key Points:**

* Focuses on **process and documentation**.
* Ensures that the software is being developed according to the specified requirements.
* Typically performed through **reviews, inspections, walkthroughs, and static analysis**.

**Example:**
Checking that a system design document correctly implements all specified requirements before coding begins.

### Validation

**Definition:**
Validation is the process of evaluating the final software product to check whether it meets the business needs and fulfills its intended purpose. It answers the question:

> “Are we building the right product?”

**Key Points:**

* Focuses on the **actual product behavior**.
* Ensures that the software works as intended in real-world scenarios.
* Typically performed through **dynamic testing**, such as functional, system, and acceptance testing.

**Example:**
Testing an e-commerce application to verify that customers can successfully add items to the cart, checkout, and receive order confirmation as expected.

**In short:**

* **Verification = building the product right**
* **Validation = building the right product**

Software testing is like inspecting a house under construction.

* **Verification:** Are we building the house correctly according to the blueprint?
* **Validation:** Is this the right house for the people who will live in it?

Testing early is like spotting a crack in the foundation before moving in. Fixing it is much cheaper and easier than repairing it later. Consider an online banking system: if a transaction fails due to a bug after launch, the financial impact could be enormous. Catching it early avoids disaster.
